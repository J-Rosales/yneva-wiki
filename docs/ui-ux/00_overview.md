# Styling and UI/UX

## Goals
- Establish the visual language for the wiki experience.
- Define the component styling system and tokens.
- Document accessibility targets.

## Open Questions
- Design source of truth: Figma, code-first, or hybrid?
- Typography system and pairing.
- Color system and layer-driven accents.
- Layout density and spacing scale.

## Deliverables
- Design tokens (colors, typography, spacing, radii, shadows).
- Component style specs (infobox, navbox, layer toggle, search results, genealogy).
- Interaction states and focus styles.

## Suggested Workflow
- Produce a baseline in Figma or a code-based style guide.
- Implement tokens in CSS variables.
- Apply tokens to existing components.

## Next Step
- Decide the design tool and workflow for UI iteration.
