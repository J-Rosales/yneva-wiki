# Article Authoring Pipeline

## Goals
- Define the end-to-end flow from Obsidian note to published wiki article.
- Specify validation, transformation, and review steps.
- Identify where automation or agent steps are appropriate.

## Open Questions
- Which steps are manual vs automated?
- How to handle metadata enrichment?
- How to manage draft vs published state?
- How to handle slug conflicts and redirects?

## Deliverables
- Pipeline diagram (ingest → validate → transform → build).
- Authoring checklist for contributors.
- Automation plan for optional LLM-assisted steps.

## Suggested Workflow
- Standardize Obsidian templates for each type.
- Run validation and build locally.
- Review generated artifacts before release.

## Next Step
- Decide the minimal authoring steps for MVP and where automation starts.
